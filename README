# Background Story

My first real physical computing project was back in Dec 2009 when the http://www.stumptown40.com was just getting started. I sat down with Bryan Fox, Kyle Drake, Robb Milne and Evan Reeves to concept a Pine Box Derby Car like no other!

You can see some early pics of the project here: https://www.facebook.com/pages/iCar-20/197944689632
